This is the PyTorch code of the [DPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08855) paper.

## Dataset Setup
Dataset paths are stored in dataset_catalog.json, which need to be modified to local paths. Please refer to the scrips from [VISSL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vissl/tree/main/extra_scripts/datasets) to download and prepare. CLIP's labels are stored in classes.json.
